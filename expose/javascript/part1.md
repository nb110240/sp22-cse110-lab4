Question 1 answer: 
    Line 9 returns - 'values added:  20'

Question 2 answer:
    Line 13 returns nothing since line 13 will only be printed if nothing is printed in Line 9 and that happens when the third parameter of the function is false. In this case it is true so Line 13 will be undefined or nothing will be printed. 

Question 3 answer: 
    Line 9 returns - 'values added:  20' (same as question1)

Question 4 answer: 
    Line 13 returns nothing since line 13 will only be printed if nothing is printed in Line 9 and that happens when the third parameter of the function is false. In this case it is true so Line 13 will be undefined or nothing will be printed. (same as Question2)

Question 5 answer: 
    Line 7 returns an Type error, assingment to constant variable when we try to assign num1 +num2 to a constant variable return. which causes an error. This means that the code would not reach line 9 and nothing will be printed out. 

Question 6: 
    Since the code would not reach line 9 it would not reach line 13 either and would cause and error. Therefore nothing will be printed out on line 13.
