Question 1 answer: 
    At line 12 the code would print out i which would be the length of prices  -1. Since i is a var variable type it can be accessed in the print statement and the print statement would return its value. 

Question 2 answer: 
    At line 13 the code would print out the discounted price of the product. Since the variable discounted price is of type var it can be accessed outside the loop and the discounted price will be printed out. 

Question 3 answer: 
    At line 14 the final price of the product will be printed out, which is just the discounted price rounded up. The final price of the product is also a variable of type var and hence can be accesed below. 

Question 4 answer: 
    This function will retutrn the discounted array but nothing will be printed out since the return value isnt asved to any variable that is getting printed out and none of the other values are getting printed out so there would be no output. 

Question 5 answer: 
    Line 12 will give an error since 'i' is of type let and let cannot be accesed outside its block and hence nothing will be printed out and an error will be formed. 

Question 6 answer: 
    Line 13 will cause an error too since discounted price is a variable of type let and let cannot be accessed outside its bloack and hence nothing will be printed and an error will be caused. 

Question 7 asnwer:
    Line 14 will print out the final price of the product. Since final price is of type let and is defined on the top of the function it can be accessed throughout and hence the final price of the product will be printed out and no error will be there. 

Question 8 answer:  
    The function would return the discounted array but nothing will be printed out since the return value isnt saved to any variable and hence there would be no output from this function.

Question 9 answer: 
    The function would cause an error at line 11 since i is not deifned outside its block since it is of type let. 

Question 10 answer:
    At line 10 the length of prices will be printed which in this case is 3. There will be no error since we do not try to chang ethe value of prices anywhere which is a const varaible type.

Question 11 answer: 
    The function would return the discounted array but nothing will be printed out since the return value isnt saved to any variable and hence there would be no output from this function.

Question 12 answers: 
    Part A:
        alert(student.name);
    Part B:
        alert(student['Grad Year']);
    Part C:
        alert(student.greeting());
    Part D:
        alert(student['Favorite Teacher'].name);
    Part E:
        alert(student.courseLoad[0]);

Question 13 answers:
    Part A:
        32: '3' is considered an integer and is joint to 2 to make 32
   Part B:
        error.
    Part C:
        3: null is considered as 0 and hence 3 + 0 is 0 
    Part D:
        error.  
    Part E: 
        4: true is considered as 1 and 1 +3 is 4.
    Part F:
        0: false and null both are considered as 0 and hence 0 + 0 = 0
    Pert E: 
        3undefined: '3' is added to undefined to make 3undefined. Here undefined is also considered as a number. 
    Part F: 
        NAN: 3 - undefined is nothing since we cannot take undefined out from anythig because it is not defined. 

Question 14 answers:
    Part A:
        The output of this comparision is - true . This is because string '2' is interprated as a number 2 and 2 > 1 hence the output is true. 
    Part B:
        the output of this comaprision is false. This is because string '12' and '2' are considered as numbers and 12 is greater than 2 so this is false. 
    Part C: 
        the output for this part is true. '2' is consdiered a number and 2 is the same as 2, hence the output is true. 
    Part D: 
        The output of this comparision is false. because === compares types and the types are different in this case
    Part E: 
        The output of this part is false. true is considered as 1 and 1 is not the same as 2, hence it is false. 
    Part F: 
        True. the two types are the same, true is also a boolean 

Question 15 answer: 
    == compares two values, whereas === compares the types of the two numbers or variables. 

Question 17 answer: 
    if the function is called with the following parameters then the reult will be [2,4,6]. This will on;y be the result if we print out the result. The way the funtion is called it does not print out anything hence the code wouldnt return anything until it is printed out. We get to this solution by calling our function do something for each element in our otiginal array. 

Question 19 answer: 
    1
    4
    3
    2
